The issue is likely with the date format being sent from your frontend to the backend. The current format ("Tue, 31 Dec\'a02024 00:00:00 GMT") might not be directly compatible with how your Python code is trying to parse dates using\'a0
\f1 pd.Timestamp
\f0 .\
To fix this, let's change the date format in your JavaScript code to use the ISO 8601 standard, which is more universally recognized and easily parsed by Python's\'a0
\f1 pd.Timestamp
\f0 .\
Update your\'a0
\f1 formatDate
\f0 \'a0function in\'a0
\f1 src/utilities/dateUtils.ts
\f0 \'a0to the following:\

\fs20 \cf2 \
\pard\pardeftab720\qc\partightenfactor0

\f2 \cf2 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs26 \cf2 This will now send dates in the format "2024-12-31T00:00:00.000Z", which should be correctly parsed by your Python backend.\
Try making this change and hitting the "Calculate Pro Forma" button again. If the error persists, we'll need to investigate further.\
